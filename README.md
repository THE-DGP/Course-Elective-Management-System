# Course-Elective-Management-System
C Program for allotting seats to students based on the priority of their elected subjects while taking into consideration total number of available seats  
## Objective
We are students of Nirma University, where just CSE has more than 300 seats.
Management of 300+ students can be really tiresome, but not if you have our code!
The program solves a major problem that it may help students to predict if they can get their desired elective subject or not. One may have unrealistic expectations that canâ€™t be met given their SPI. So if they have a rough idea about it, they can give first priority to the subject that they are sure to get.
## Overview
The program involves usage of Structures, Linked Lists and Array.
The program first takes user input that is the number of electives. A list is created which stores the name of elective and number of seats to be allotted for that particular elective. Further another list is created that stores the student details which involves student name, student roll number and the SPI of that student.
Further the list of electives is displayed and the user is asked to enter the number corresponding to the elective in order of the desired priority. After all these information is entered and stored the program then displays a menu that allows user to view the list of electives, details of student and what elective they are allotted, search student details using roll number and change student elective.
To make it interactive it is also required by the user to enter a password to start the program. Various colours are used to make the program look presentable.
## Requirements
Written in C language.
