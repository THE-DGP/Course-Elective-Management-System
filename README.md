# Course-Elective-Management-System
C Program for allotting seats to students based on the priority of their elected subjects while taking into consideration total number of available seats  
## Objective
We are students of Nirma University, where just CSE has more than 300 seats.
Management of 300+ students can be really tiresome, but not if you have our code!
The program solves a major problem that it may help students to predict if they can get their desired elective subject or not. One may have unrealistic expectations that canâ€™t be met given their SPI. So if they have a rough idea about it, they can give first priority to the subject that they are sure to get.
## Requirements
Written in C language.
